				  especially a language with other characters than the Latin ones. Using this site makes understanding and memorizing
				  of the foreign characters easier by explaining through animated images and a canvas for user's drawings in which

				<h2>The main page</h2>
				<p>
					The main page is divided into three sections each of one dedicated to specific purposes. The first one, the top menu,
					present on all the rest of pages reveals the current state of the user: unlogged, in order to save progress it is essentially to
					register or log and logged, all the progresses are recorded and it can be accessed whenever the user will connect. On this
					top menu there are links to the first page and the other sites one, making the navigation through the site clear and easy.
					The second section, the left menu is adaptable to how many languages are introduced into the learning program, so the site
					can be improved and updated with more languages and new characters. By selecting one of the existing languages through the first button it will set
					the symbols list for that and pressing the symbol button it will show a list of selectable letters correlated to the
					transliteration with Latin characters.
					The third section consists in a slide-show based on the selected symbol from the previous menu from where it is shown 
					the steps of drawing the letter through a animated image. This animation can be reviewed only if the mouse steps over the box in which sits the static 
					image of the symbol. Next to the slide-show is the most important area of the site: the drawing canvas. From this area
					user can exercise the way of drawing the symbols organizing the process of learning new letters in a natural way: first
					it is presented and drew step by step, then, as a evaluation the user is asked to re-draw the character following the rules presented previously
					and then the result is checked and it is given a feedback to the user. As important tools associated with the drawing canvas 
					it can be mentioned the brush and the eraser for editing the image, and "save" and "clear" buttons for trial and for initializing the
					checking process.
